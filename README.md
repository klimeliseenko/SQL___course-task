# SQL

In the course i had the following task:

Prerequisites: Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench (version below 8.20)



1) Our task is to deal with simple and slightly complicated queries to databases written in SQL



Download the Hogwarts database dumps from here https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1MC0AttnmlAmugifFlX3hG6pssYZDqpPB

Import tables using Workbench

Complete task 1 and 2, which you will find here https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1Lt7CY69nR5awNs_9q0XJOHRti4vJj3Qa

Save your solution as a Word document, where you need to add screenshots of sent requests to the CLI or Workbench



Remember that most errors occur due to incorrect syntax and the use of operators. Be careful. Check the results of the sent requests to be sure of your decision





2) Outdated version (you can run it too, there is a sample solution)



The attachment contains instructions for completing the task. The table from the database (Demo Database) can be found here https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp
